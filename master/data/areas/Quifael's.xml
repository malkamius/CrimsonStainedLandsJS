bookcases filled with dusty volumes of all sizes.  In the fireplace burns a

reading desk is a large old-fashioned chair.</Description>

          <Description>Most of the books are heavy, leatherbound and covered in a thin layer of dust.
There are many titles on necromancy, conjuring and other spheres of Magick,
but also some on computer science (although these seem to be VERY dusty
indeed) and a fair collection of horror literature, ranging from Bram Stoker
and H. P. Lovecraft to Anne Rice and Stephen King.</Description>

      <Description>You are on a transparent balcony hanging in mid-air.  You notice a faint blue
glow surrounding everything, even yourself, making it seem as transparent as
the balcony itself.  From here, you have a terrific view of the whole Forest
of Haon-Dor.  A transparent bronze plate has been bolted to the balcony
railing.  A magical portal is hovering in the air to the west.</Description>

Do not lean out!
Please do not try to attract the attention of any
adventurers in the forest, as you are not
really in existence at the moment.
(This could possibly mess up Reality,
and we wouldn't want to do that, would we?)</Description>
