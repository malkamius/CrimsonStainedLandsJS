    <Help VNum="1100235" Level="0" Keyword="alignment good neutral evil" LastEditedBy="Giaken" LastEditedOn="2023-08-19T20:02:51.1818461-05:00">Good: Characters who are aligned with "good" believe in altruism, respect
for life, and a desire to help others. They tend to make choices that
benefit not just themselves but also those around them, often at their own
expense. Good characters are compassionate and will often go out of their
way to prevent harm to innocents. They uphold values of kindness, charity,
and self-sacrifice. 

Neutral: Neutral characters tend to be more pragmatic
and do not feel a strong pull towards either extreme of good or evil. Their
actions may be driven by personal gain, a sense of balance, or the specific
situation at hand rather than an inherent moral code. Neutral characters
might believe in a natural balance and might act to restore that balance if
they feel it's been disrupted. They may also prioritize their own
well-being or the well-being of their close companions over broader ethical
or moral considerations. 

Evil: Characters who are "evil" prioritize their
own needs and desires over those of others and may be willing to harm or
manipulate others to achieve their goals. They might be driven by greed,
power, anger, hatred, or a desire for revenge. Evil characters might not
necessarily be cruel or violent, but they tend to lack empathy for others,
especially if there's a conflict between their interests and the well-being
of others. It's worth noting that these alignments serve as broad
categories, and within them, there can be a lot of variation. For example,
one "good" character might be driven by a strong sense of justice, while
another might prioritize mercy. Similarly, an "evil" character could be a
ruthless tyrant or a cunning manipulator. The alignment system helps
players think about their characters' motivations and can guide
decision-making within the game, but it's always up to individual
interpretation.

Good and evil characters receive bonus experience for
slaying a character of the opposite alignment.</Help>
    <Help VNum="1100245" Level="0" Keyword="ethos orderly neutral chaotic" LastEditedBy="Giaken" LastEditedOn="2023-08-19T20:09:18.9752668-05:00">Lawful (often referred to as Orderly): Characters with a lawful alignment
believe in a structured society, rules, order, and tradition. They value
discipline, responsibility, and adherence to a set code of behavior,
whether personal or dictated by a governing body. Lawful characters might
respect authority, keep their promises, and try to always act within the
confines of the law. Their predictability is both a strength and a
weakness. It's important to note that "lawful" doesn't necessarily mean
"good"; a character can be lawful and evil, adhering strictly to a code or
set of laws that are oppressive or harmful. 

Neutral (with respect to ethos): Neutral characters, in terms of ethos, fall 
between the extremes of lawfulness and chaos. They might respect order and 
authority when it suits them or their goals but don't inherently adhere to 
them. Similarly, they don't actively seek to disrupt order or sow chaos. 
Their actions are often driven by what seems appropriate at the moment, 
making them flexible and pragmatic. They tend to prioritize personal 
freedom and will generally go with whatever system or approach offers 
them the best balance of security and freedom. 

Chaotic: Chaotic characters value individual freedom over
structure and order. They are skeptical of authority and often resist
rules, regulations, and traditions, seeing them as constraints. They
prioritize personal freedom and often act based on their whims or personal
desires rather than any external code of behavior. Like with the lawful
alignment, "chaotic" does not inherently mean "evil"; a chaotic good
character, for example, might defy oppressive laws to do what they believe
is right.</Help>
