      <Name>a dirt path</Name>
      <Description>You stand in the middle of a faint dirt path.  This path is well kept but 
appears as if it is very seldom used.  To the north you can make out a 
small stone building behind a great tree, the thundering sounds of a 
hammer striking an anvil can be heard coming from the building.</Description>

      <Description>You are still on the path and the building and tree are now closer and 
still to the north.  Ahead of you the path seems to bend around the tree 
on its way towards the small building.  The air around you seems to be 
getting hotter as you near the building and the sound of the hammer has 
grown to a near deafening volume. To the South you can make out the 
begining of the trail.</Description>

      <Description>Right before the path reaches the giant tree it begins to bend around it. 
The tree now obscures your view of the small building but the din of the 
hammer has reached unbearable levels and the air here is considerable 
warmer then that at the begining of the path.  the path veers to the east 
to go around the giant tree.</Description>

      <Description>You can again make out the building to the north and you are close enough 
to make out the individual stone blocks which make it up.  To the west is 
the massive tree and looking up you cannot make out the top as it reaches 
into the heavens.  at the base of the tree a dwarf sits with a mug of ale 
in his hand and greets you as you pass. the path continues to the north 
towards the house and to the west around the tree.</Description>

      <Description>You are now much closer to the building and nearly past the tree.  The 
heat emmitted from the building is intense and the ringing of the hammer 
is even more prevalent.  Smoke pours from a small chimny above the 
building into the sky creating a small pillar of smoke until it disperses 
into the air.  The Tree is still to your West and the trail goes on to the 
north towards the building and back to the south where it disapears behind 
the tree.</Description>

      <Description>You stand before the building in a small dusty courtyard.  You can now 
here the sounds of many hammers striking anvils and here the shouts of men 
from within the building.  The building itself appears to be made of a 
pale grey stone and its door is made of a reddish wood.  In all the 
building appears to be a very plain forge. On the door of the forge an 
image depicting a large two headed hammer has been engraved in gold, 
silver, steel, iron, and wood.</Description>

the gnomish tinker has his workspace.  Cracked pots, bent swords, and 
dented armor all lay around waiting to be mended, while other objects seem

currently trying to attach a spring to a pot for some reason.To the south
