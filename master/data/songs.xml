    <Lyrics>
I used to struggle just to take a stroll,
But now I'm moving with a rhythm and roll.
Gone are the days of feeling so slow,
Cause I can move it and I'm ready to go.
I'll do the cha-cha, tango and swing,
All with a smile and a joyful sing.
I'm feeling so light, like a feather in air,
Cause moving longer is just beyond compare.

Broken bones and scars,
Pain and sufferings ours,
But the will to be whole,

With faith and hope in hand,
We can heal and take a stand,
And rise above the aches and tears,
The journey to wellness is here.

With every word I sing, my voice echoes far
Revealing secrets hidden, like stars in the sky
The truth once lost now shines, a guiding light
In this musical journey I embark
One verse, a song to reveal all that is hidden
The truth that was lost, now found and forbidden
With every note I play, a story is rebidden.

In this dark and lonely hall, I stand alone and still
With words so strong and true, I cast this curse with will
The foes that roam this land, with malice in their heart
Shall feel the power of my voice, and know its impart.
A curse upon them all, in this haunted place
Their strength and power waning, their movements slow with grace
Their once fierce eyes, now dim with fear and pain
And in this somber moment, they will feel its chain.

I unleash the frost, a deadly wreath.
With each note, the ice shall flow,

My song brings death in a single slice.
With magic in my voice and power in my sound,
All who face me shall feel my deadly round.

With every word, a peaceful vibe,
In this room, sweet dreams will surely abide.
