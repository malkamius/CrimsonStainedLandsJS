*** Copyright and License Terms

Diku Mud is copyright (C) 1990, 1991 by Sebastian Hammer, Michael Seifert,
Hans Henrik St{rfeldt, Tom Madsen, and Katja Nyboe.  Their license
agreement is in the file 'license.doc'.

Merc Diku Mud is a derivative of the original Diku Mud and is subject to
their copyright and license agreement.  Merc Diku Mud contains substantial
enhancements to Diku Mud.  These enhancements are copyright 1992, 1993 by
Michael Chastain, Michael Quan, and Mitchell Tse.

ROM 2.4 is a further derivative of Diku and Merc that adds further
enhancements to the code base. ROM is copyright 1993 - 1996 by Russ
Taylor.

Tartarus is a derivative of ROM and is fully subject to the
ROM consortium's copyright and license, as well as prior Diku and Merc
licenses.  It provides many additions to base Diku/Merc/Rom and has a lot
of modified merc/ROM code. The Tartarus Code enhancedments and additions 
are copyright (C) 1997, 1998 by Daniel Graham.

In order to use Tartarus code you must follow the Diku license
(license.doc), the Merc license (license.txt), and the ROM license
(rom.license). And, to make things more annoying, you must also follow the
Tartarus license. A summary of license terms, which may all be found in
the /Tartarus/doc directory are:

For Diku Mud:

        -- No resale or operation for profit.
        -- Original author's names must appear in login sequence.
        -- The 'credits' command must report original authors.
        -- You must notify the Diku creators that you are operating a Diku mud.

For Merc Mud code:

        -- Copyrights must remain in original source.
        -- 'Help merc' must report our help text, as shipped.

For ROM code:

	-- Original author's name (Russ Taylor) must appear in login
	sequence.
	-- Must email aothor of ROM before you run it.
	-- You may not use the name ROM in your mud's name.

For this code (Tartarus):
 
	-- No resale or use for profit of any tartarus code.
	-- The original author and his ackowledgement credits must be
	reported in the 'help tartarus' command as shipped with the original
	source. 

However:
-- You do not have to include the -Tartarus code- author's name in the
login sequence (hell, with all the other stuff you already need to include
from the Diku, Merc and Rom licenses there probably wouldn't be room
anyway). It would be nice to be included but you need only include the
prerequisite Diku and ROM authors. 

--You may modify and redistribute Tartarus code without restriction as
long as the original credits are given with the distribution. -However-
you must adhere to the original licenses of Diku, Merc and ROM authors if
you wish to use code that is specifically from their code releases (if
you don't know which parts of the code are from which derivative base
then you should either: ask for advice on it, obtain copies of their
original releases and check what they coded, or not use it).

These are basic terms of use for Tartarus code. If you don't want to
accept these terms and follow them then feel free to write your own,
or to simply obtain copies of  Diku/Merc/Rom without Tartarus code and run
that. Whatever you choose, have fun with it.
